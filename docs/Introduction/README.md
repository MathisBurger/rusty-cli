# Introduction

rusty-cli is a multipurpose cli library. That means you can use the library for
many implementations. There are features like the implemented command handler with flags
or the internal file reader that uses the OS app directories to 
store your files. To put it in a nutshell, it could be quite
hard to find around in this project. Therefore, just follow the examples provided in the
repository or read the documentation carefully.
